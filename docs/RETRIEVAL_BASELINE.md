# Retrieval baseline

Official-record retrieval uses a transparent union rather than one opaque similarity
score:

1. return every exact normalized NIE candidate;
2. block lexical candidates by normalized brand and informative product-name tokens;
3. rank at most 5,000 blocked records with character TF-IDF n-grams (3-5) and RapidFuzz;
4. preserve retrieval sources and deterministic record-ID tie breaking.

Evaluation reports Recall@1, Recall@5, Recall@20, and mean reciprocal rank on positive
pairs. Run both normal mode and `--lexical-only`; the latter removes NIE to prevent an
exact lookup from hiding weak name retrieval. Synthetic metrics are baselines, not the
headline gold-test result.
